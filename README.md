# Simon Project

## The project aims to build a small game called Simon, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### How the games work:

1. Simon is a game to help memory skill, in which it creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
2. The user presses any key on the keyboard to start the game. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color button.
3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color buttons, in order.
4. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.
5. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly. 
6. If the user succeeds, next level begins and the game becomes progressively longer and more complex.
7. Once the user fails, the game is over.
8. User repress the keyboard again to restart the game.
