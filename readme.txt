# Simon Project

## The project aims to build a small game called Simon, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### How the games work:

1. Simon is a game to help memory skill, in which it creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
2. The user presses any key on the keyboard to start the game.
2. If the user succeeds, next level begins and the game becomes progressively longer and more complex.
3. Once the user fails, the game is over.
4. User repress the keyboard again to restart the game.
